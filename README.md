## Objectives
- Analyze factors affecting employee retention.
- Identify trends and patterns in employee promotions.
- Understand causes and impacts of retrenchments.
- Provide visualization dashboards for decision-making.

## Datasets Used
1. **HR Employee Data**
   - General employee details, such as demographics and job information.
2. **HR Analytics Data**
   - Metrics like performance scores, satisfaction levels, and other HR metrics.
